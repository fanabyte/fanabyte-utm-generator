## Description

The FanaByte UTM Generator plugin simplifies the process of creating UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) links for Google Analytics directly within your WordPress website. It allows users to generate trackable URLs with custom source, medium, campaign, term, and content parameters, helping to accurately measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

## Installation

1.  **Upload the plugin:**
    * Download the plugin ZIP file.
    * Go to your WordPress admin area, navigate to `Plugins > Add New`.
    * Click on `Upload Plugin` and select the downloaded ZIP file.
    * Click `Install Now` and then `Activate Plugin`.

2.  **Create the UTM Generator Page:**
    * After activation, a new menu item "UTM Link" will appear in your WordPress admin sidebar.
    * Navigate to `UTM Link > UTM Link`.
    * On this page, you will find an option to automatically create a new WordPress page containing the UTM generator form. Click the "Creating a Page containing the UTM link creation form" button (or its Persian equivalent).
    * Alternatively, you can manually create a new page (`Pages > Add New`) and insert the shortcode `[fanabyte_utm_generator]` into its content.

## Usage

Once the UTM generator page is created and accessible, visitors (or administrators, depending on how you set up the page) can use the form to generate UTM links.

1.  **Website URL:** Enter the full URL of your website (e.g., `https://fanabyte.com`).
2.  **Campaign Source:** Specify the source of your traffic (e.g., `google`, `newsletter`, or the name of a website where your campaign is placed).
3.  **Campaign Medium:** Define the medium of your campaign (e.g., `cpc`, `banner`, `email`).
4.  **Campaign Name:** Provide a descriptive name for your campaign (e.g., `summer_sale`, `eid_nowruz`).
5.  **Campaign Term (Optional):** Add keywords for paid search campaigns (e.g., `discount_code`).
6.  **Campaign Content (Optional):** Differentiate between ads within the same campaign (e.g., `banner_ad`, `text_link`).

After filling in the required fields, click "Generate UTM" to get your final UTM-tagged URL. A "Copy UTM" button will appear to easily copy the generated link to your clipboard.

## Features
